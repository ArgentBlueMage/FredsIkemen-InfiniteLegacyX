Fair warning:
-------------

This is a director's cut version of KFM-Ultra. It includes cut content that some people might find offensive.
None of the content is meant for insulting anyone directly and it's meant only for comedic purposes. 
If you're easily offended please refrain from using this character.

--------------
Warning notes:
--------------

- Character is not suitable for all ages due to high rate of violence, gore, drug use and suggestive jokes.

- Even if this is a mugen 1.0 character I recommend using mugen 1.1b due to lag which occurs in mugen 1.0 caused by character's bloated .sff and helper abuse.

- Character doesn't work well on stages with moving floors.

- If you downloaded this character from somewhere else you probably got an edited or outdated version of this character.

-------------------
Introduction notes:
-------------------

- This is basically an experimental character with crazy amount of moves and stuff. The character is mostly inspired by YTPs and Postal 2.

-------------
Core details:
-------------

---------
Movelist:
---------

-Basic stuff-

x - Light Punch
y - Medium Punch
z - Heavy Punch
a - Light Kick
b - Medium Kick
c - Heavy Kick
start - Gun Taunt

Usual combos: 

- x,y,z (stand, crouch, air)
- a,b,c (stand, crouch, air)
- x,a,b,c (stand)
- a,y,z (stand)
- crouch (x), stand (x,a,b,c)
- crouch (a), stand (a,b,c)

- You can press any button to shoot while taunting. It's possible to do combos with taunt's second phase. After handgun you can cancel into shotgun then into Super shotgun or/then into AK47. After shotgun you can cancel into super shotgun or/then into AK47.

-Tech Stuff-

x+y - Dodge (Hold forward to do forward dodge roll; Hold back to do backward dodge roll)
y+z - Counter/Alpha Counter (Takes half of one stack of powerbar energy. While guarding you can press y+z to do the alpha counter which takes half a stack of power)
a+b - Kick Throw (Hold forward or backward to decide where to throw the opponent)
b+c - Gun Throw (Hold forward or backward to decide where to throw the opponent)
y+b - Powercharge (Fills only half of one stack of powerbar energy each time you use it. You can charge it up to three stacks of powerbar energy.)

While knocked down you can press forward or back to do rolling recovery.

-Items-

x+a - Health (Crack) Pipe
z+c - Catnip

Note: Items are shown on Postal 2 HUD.

Crack and Catnip explanation:

- Press x+a to smoke a crack pipe. You get crack by having less than 420 of health. By using it you get your health restored to the maximum. The heart attack timer starts once you get into crack mode. When timer runs out you lose half of your current health. The heart on postal 2 hud is an indicator for crack addiction mode. Once it starts pumping faster it means that you're pretty close to get a heart attack. 

- Press z+c to smoke catnip. You get catnip by filling all 5 stacks of powerbar. You get into slow mode in which you can cheese the enemies with various attacks until slow mode timer runs out. You cannot do hyper attacks in slow mode. You can use catnip as an antidote to cure your crack addiction (that means that crack mode timer restarts to zero permanently). You cannot use catnip in mirror matches. Also the gun projectiles' damage gets lowered down a bit in catnip mode.

Crack and Catnip are not available in simul mode. Postal 2 HUD is also not present in simul mode as well.
