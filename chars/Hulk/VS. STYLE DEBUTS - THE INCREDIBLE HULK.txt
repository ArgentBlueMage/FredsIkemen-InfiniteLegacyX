"LET'S ROCK!" - Hulk

For the first time in VS. Style Debuts story: A MARVEL CHARACTER! And it's our favorite Green Giant hero!

================================= Why HULK? =================================

Since the Marvel VS. Capcom 1 game, I always liked to throw Gamma Slams and Gamma Waves at the opponent. Also because Hulk is one of my favorite heroes from Marvel Comics(And also one of my favorite characters in UCM)

==================================== HULK STORY ====================================

Read Marvel comics, especially Hulk's ones. Or search for some resumes of his story in official wikias.

=============================== MOVELIST =====================================================

[X-Ability]:

"Godlike Gamma Warrior"

BASIC SYSTEM:


======[SYSTEM MOVES]:

Super Jump: D, U [Only "U" after you hit a launcher]
Dash/Hop Backward: FF/BB
Advancing Guard: 2 PUNCHES in Guard
Overwhelming Landing(Also called: AERIAL RAVE FINISHER): MP(H)/HP/HK after a Weak-to-Strong chain
COUNTER-ATTACK(Finally I can put a decent and easy Counter-Attack on characters): F, LP+LK/MP+MK when in defense (Power Cost = 1000)

(H) - Exclusively for Hulk, he have three aerial finishers. The basic HK and HP after a aerial rave, and MP. This was a common thing on Marvel VS Capcom old games.

Avalanche Leap: At corner wall, press Forward. He will do a aerial dash, like in Marvel VS. Capcom: INFINITE.

- Gamma Crush: D,DB,B + 2 Punches

* = Level 3
** = Level 3 "Ômega Combo"



NOTE: Originally I was planning to put the "Focus Attack" move from MvCI and a brand new level 3. But later I'll decide that

Trivia: Honestly, Gamma Wave sounds better than Gamma Tsunami.
