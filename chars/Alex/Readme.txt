- Altered Air Stampede's movement.
- Visual tweaks and fixes.
- Other rather minor adjustments.

13th February 2023:
So keep it brief and easier (for me), here's the changes from his SF All-Stars counterpart.
- 9000,1 Port Changed to an updated version of what's seen in the edit of Varo's.
- Voice changed to 3rd Strike's.
- Changed what moves can be cancelled (currently matches 3rd Strike's rules).
- Restored Super Cancels.
- Various Hitbox and Frame Data tweaked.
- Custom Combo and Power Charge animations tweaked.
- Removed const(size.x/yscale) from movement velocities and posadds.
- Rapid-Firing for LPs improved.
- Lariat has stronger dampening during CC (Thanks Trololo).
- Special Throws use the proper PotS throw triggers.
- Fixed Debug Error involving throws that have Turnaround alts.
- Headbutt can now be blocked.
- MP Flash Chop Turnaround time increased slightly.
- Non-EX Slash Elbows share the same hitboxes.
- Air Knee Smash's movement better matches 3rd Strike's.
- Removed added Counter Hit/Slide Time from Specials.
- Fixed Boomerang Raid's grab hitdef hitting like the chop hitdef.
- Fixed Boomerang Raid's invincibility.
- Stun Gun Headbutt has faster startup, with a slightly shorter jump. It can also now be properly cancelled into and can't hit air opponents.
- Your usual misc. tweaks.

Known Issues:
- EX Flash Chop's projectile shield does 2 hits when it stops a projectile.

To Do:
- Properly add the Power Bomb to Boomerang Raid.
- Move Hyper Bomb to a Level 1/2.
- Add Backdrop Bomb.
	(The first two are likely to be done in an Alex done from scratch)
- Attend to Feedback.
