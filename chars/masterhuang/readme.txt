Master Huang.
Made by Kenshin Himura.
Version: Beta.
Date of creation (wip): 18.09.2009
From: Martial Masters.
-----------------------------------------
About: 
I believed that in order to improve my coding skills it was needed to do a more complex character so I´ve turned my eyes
to Master Huang from Martial Masters which a friend of mine was making, but he gave up. Much effort was done on this wip
and the release is because I need several help to made him more complete. There are many issues which I could not add on
him like the Flash Attack and Shadow Move. Any help on coding is apreciated.
