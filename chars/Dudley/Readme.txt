<16.11.2021>
- See Changelog.txt for updates by BurningSoul and Virtua Richie

<18.11.2016>
- Added color separation, thanks to DizzyTheConquer! (And Rei Seiryuu / ShinRei! XD)
- Added Infinite's Palette-selector
- Added tons of Palettes (thanks to MFG! XD)
- Added his car-intro (thanks to Rei, again! XD)
- Added his "Down for the count!" win pose
- Nerfed some moves that did excessive damage
- Changed Jet Upper's guard-flags. It can no longer be blocked in mid-air.
  (Same for the EX version)
- Changed the Normals' juggle thingy
- Updated the small-portrait. Thanks to HadeS! :D
- Minor changes/bug fixes.
- (To the Mugen 1.1 version): Added CAMERA-ZOOMS EVERYWHERE.
  Thanks to Beterhans for discovering this method.
  Before, it only had Zoom-compatible beams and projectiles.
  But now, the Super-pauses have zoom-in, the Corkscrew Cross, MAX Rolling Thunder,
  EX Cross-Counter, and all throws TOO have Camera-Zoom.
  It's now a HUGE improvement from last version. It really feels like an actual fighting game.
  This is a major difference between the 1.1 and 1.0 versions.
  You can disable the Zoom in the CONFIG.TXT file.

<14.10.2016>
- Reduced all damage. He was kinda broken imo, since, it's just Dudley.
  He might be cool af, yeah, but he's not a boss char-
  (A high-tier one, indeed, but not a boss chararcter.)
- Improved the special effects of the MAX Rolling Thunder
- Fixed the one bug with the delayed hitspakrs.
- Made a shitload of minor changes/bug fixes
- Look the 13.07.2015 update up m8, I didn't get to post it back then.

<13.07.2015>
- The rose can now be hit by any projectile/attack.
- The Rolling Thunder will connect mor efficently.
- Fixed a bug that made the Corkscrew Cross get the opponent lay down ifninitely.
  (rarely happened, but still... )
- Added different types of invincibility in most of the moves.
  (Machine Gun Blow has invincibility to normal projectiles during the startup, etc)
- Changed the GuardFlag of most EX Specials.

<29.06.2015>
- Fixed the one bug with the "normal" .DEF files... heh <:D

<21.06.2015>
- First release.
