Rowen's feedback:

1. I think he's missing his coat for the 'Let's fight like gentlemen' intro.

2. EX Jet Upper does the same amount of damage as the normal version.

3. He seems to lose health upon doing Cross Counter and lacks the guard sound. This isn't the case with the EX version.

- this is how cross counter works, when boxers take a hit to give a hit but normal version is missing impact sound from p2's attack
- EX cross counter was buffed to not absorb damage (hence armour hit sound), may be a SF4 thing		

4. Corkscrew Cross still has cornerpush so all hits won't connect properly. 

- the whole thing needs tweaking for more impactful feel
