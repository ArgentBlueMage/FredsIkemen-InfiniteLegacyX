added dampener vars to normals
target combos + dampener TCs
crouch HK no longer cancellable, but juggle with EX uppercut and rocket uppercut
tweaked special uppercut and super uppercut anims based on 3s
fixed dudley landing below the floor by 5 pixels on landing frames during rocket uppercut
increased tempo of machinegun punches +3 on hit
ex shortswing blow tweaks: shorter hitpause on first hit, decreased x velocity, increased yaccel
ex ducking uppercut: higher y velocity, more yaccel
corkscrew cross: S physics in custom state so that P2 is less "slidey" on icey
