 ;This parameter lets you set the range over which the shadow is
 ;visible. The first value is the high level, and the second is

 ;A shadow is invisible if the player is above the high level,
 ;and fully visible if below the middle level. The shadow is
 ;faded in between the two levels. This gives an effect of the
 ;shadow fading away as the player gets farther away from the

[Music]
 ;Put a filename for a MOD, MP3 or MIDI here, or just leave it

 ;0 will play a random audio track. For example, to play
 ;track 3 from a music CD, use:
 ;  bgmusic = 3.da
bgmusic = 3D_Test.mp3

bgmloopend = 1078380
